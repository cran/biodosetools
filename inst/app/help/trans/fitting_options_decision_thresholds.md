#### Detection limits

The detection limit is the lowest estimated dose in which the lower confidence limit of the dose estimation is above 0 Gy.

In the case of translocations, the detection limits will be calculated with respect to the fitting using the translocations measured by FISH, regardless of the fitting method selected.

Introduce a list of number of total cells, `N`, for which you want to calculate the detection limits.
